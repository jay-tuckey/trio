You have completed the turorial, and are enthusiastic about building
great new applications and libraries with async functionality.
However, to get much useful work done you will want to use some of
the great libraries that support trio-flavoured concurrency. This list
is not complete, but gives a starting point.


Core Trio Libraries
-------------------

These libraries are part of the `python-trio Github team <https://github.com/python-trio>`__ and will be used in
many trio projects:

* `cookiecutter-trio <https://github.com/python-trio/cookiecutter-trio>`__ - Quickstart template for Trio projects
* `pytest-trio <https://github.com/python-trio/pytest-trio>`__ - Pytest plugin for trio
* `trio-typing <https://github.com/python-trio/trio-typing>`__ - Type hints for Trio and related projects
* `sphinxcontrib-trio <https://github.com/python-trio/sphinxcontrib-trio>`__ - Make Sphinx better at documenting Python functions and methods
* `trio-click <https://github.com/python-trio/trio-click>`__ - Python composable command line utility, trio-compatible version
* `triopg <https://github.com/python-trio/triopg>`__ - PostgreSQL client for Trio based on asyncpg
* `trio-mysql <https://github.com/python-trio/trio-mysql>`__ - Pure Python MySQL Client
* `hypothesis-trio <https://github.com/python-trio/hypothesis-trio>`__ - Hypothesis plugin for trio


Web and HTML Libraries
----------------------

* `asks <https://github.com/theelous3/asks>`__ - asks is an async requests-like http library
* `trustme <https://github.com/python-trio/trustme>`__ - #1 quality TLS certs while you wait, for the discerning tester
* `trio-websocket <https://github.com/HyperionGray/trio-websocket>`__ - This library implements the WebSocket protocol, striving for safety, correctness, and ergonomics.

Database Libraries
------------------

* `triopg <https://github.com/python-trio/triopg>`__ - PostgreSQL client for Trio based on asyncpg
* `trio-mysql <https://github.com/python-trio/trio-mysql>`__ - Pure Python MySQL Client
* `sqlalchemy_aio <https://github.com/RazerM/sqlalchemy_aio>`__ - Add asyncio and Trio support to SQLAlchemy core, derived from alchimia.
